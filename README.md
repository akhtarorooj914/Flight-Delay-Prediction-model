This project has been completed as an internship project for Tata Steel Summer Intership program

In the dynamic realm of air travel, the ability to predict flight delays accurately has become an essential pursuit for both passengers and aviation industry stakeholders.
Delays can lead to inconvenience for passengers and operational challenges for airlines. This project delves into the realm of Machine Learning (ML) with a focus on Flight Delay Prediction, utilizing a Kaggle dataset as the cornerstone of analysis.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a comprehensive collection of features related to flight schedules, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. 
Through the lens of exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to unravel patterns, correlations, and insights that can aid in understanding the nuances of flight delays.

Our journey into this dataset involves employing two powerful machine learning algorithms - Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression. 
These models are chosen for their efficacy in classification tasks and interpretability.
Decision Tree Classifier, known for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, will be employed to discern intricate decision boundaries within the dataset.
Meanwhile, Logistic Regression, a robust and widely-used algorithm, will contribute to our predictive arsenal.

The overarching goal of this project is twofold: to harness the predictive capabilities of machine learning in forecasting flight delays and to extract meaningful information
from the dataset through a meticulous exploratory data analysis. By combining these two approaches, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing flight delays 
and deliver a predictive model that can contribute to more informed decision-making in the aviation domain.
